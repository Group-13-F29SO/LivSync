## Git Branching Workflow

### Creating a Branch and Submitting Changes

After completing your code changes, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. Stage your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit with a descriptive message:
   ```
   git commit -m "your-message-here"
   ```

4. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Continuing Development

If you're still working on the same feature, continue to commit and push in the same branch (steps 3 & 4). For subsequent commits, use `git push` instead of `git push -u origin your-branch-name`.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once your work in the branch is complete:

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button (yellow banner with your branch name)
3. Verify that:
   - Base branch is set to `main`
   - Compare branch is set to `your-branch-name`
4. Add a descriptive title and description
5. Click "Create Pull Request"

### Code Review Process

**For Reviewers:**

1. Go to the repository and navigate to "Pull Requests"
2. Select the pull request to review
3. Review the changes in the "Files changed" tab
4. Click "Review changes" (green button)
5. Add comments and select "Approve"
6. Confirm your review

**Merging:**
Once approved, either the reviewer or the author can merge the pull request. The PR will close automatically upon successful merge.
The branch can then be deleted.

### Post-Merge Updates

After the branch has been merged to `main`, all team members must update their local repository:

1. Switch to main branch:
   ```
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```
